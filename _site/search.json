    "text": "Geospatial Data Science is the process of importing, wrangling, integrating, and processing geographically referenced data sets. In this hands-on exercise, the goal is to learn how to perform geospatial data science tasks in R by using sf package.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise the following competencies should be acquired:\n\ninstalling and loading sf and tidyverse packages into R environment,\nimporting geospatial data by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nimporting aspatial data by using appropriate function of readr package,\nexploring the contents of simple feature data frame by using appropriate Base R and sf functions,\nassigning or transforming coordinate systems by using using appropriate sf functions,\nconverting an aspatial data into a sf data frame by using appropriate function of sf package,\nperforming geoprocessing tasks by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nperforming data wrangling tasks by using appropriate functions of dplyr package and\nperforming Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by using appropriate functions from ggplot2 package.\n\n\nNote: It is encouraged to read the reference guide of each function, especially the input data requirements, syntext and argument option before using them.\n\n\n\n\nData is key to data analytics which also includes geospatial analytics. Hence, before analysis it is required to assemble the necessary data. For this hands-on exercise the data will be extracted from the following sources:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\n\nNote: This section does not merely constitute to extracting the necessary data sets. It also aims to introduce the usage of publicly available data sets.\n\n\n\nThe following steps have been carried out for extraction of the data sets:\nIn the Hands-on_Ex01 folder, a sub-folder called data is created. Then, inside the data sub-folder, two other sub-folders are created and are named geospatial and aspatial respectively.\nThe downloaded zipped files Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web), Pre-Schools Location and Cycling Path are placed into geospatial sub-folder and unzipped. The unzipped files are then copied from their respective sub-folders and placed inside the geospatial sub-folder.\n\n\n\nThe downloaded listing data file is extracted. And placed in the Downloads folder by cutting and pasting the listing.csv file into the aspatial sub-folder.\n\n\n\n\nTHe following 2 R packages will be used for this hands-on exercise:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nTidyverse consists of a family of R packages. In this hands-on exercise, the following packages will be used:\n\nreadr for importing csv data,\nreadxl for importing Excel worksheet,\ntidyr for manipulating data,\ndplyr for transforming data, and\nggplot2 for visualising data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if sf and tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, the geospatial data is imported into R by using st_read() of sf package:\n\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format,\nCyclingPath, a line feature layer in ESRI shapefile format, and\nPreSchool, a point feature layer in kml file format.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() function of sf package to import MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile into R as a polygon feature data frame. Note that when the input geospatial data is in shapefile format, two arguments will be used, namely: dsn to define the data path and layer to provide the shapefile name.\nAlso note that no extension such as .shp, .dbf, .prj and .shx are needed.\n\nmpsz = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                  layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nReading layer `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL' from data source \n  `C:\\zjho008\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe message above reveals that the geospatial objects are multipolygon features. There are a total of 323 multipolygon features and 15 fields in mpsz simple feature data frame. mpsz is in svy21 projected coordinates systems. The bounding box provides the x extend and y extend of the data.\n\n\n\nAgain, the code chunk below uses st_read() function of sf package to import CyclingPath shapefile into R but as a line feature data frame.\n\ncyclingpath = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                         layer = \"CyclingPathGazette\")\n\nReading layer `CyclingPathGazette' from data source \n  `C:\\zjho008\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 3138 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTILINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 11854.32 ymin: 28347.98 xmax: 42644.17 ymax: 48948.15\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe message above reveals that the geospatial objects are linestring features. There are a total of 3138 features and 2 fields in cyclingpath linestring feature data frame and it is in svy21 projected coordinates system as well.\n\n\n\nThe PreSchoolsLocation is in kml format. The code chunk below will be used to import the kml file into R. Notice that in the code chunk below, the complete path and the kml file extension were provided.\n\npreschool = st_read(\"data/geospatial/PreSchoolsLocation.kml\")\n\nReading layer `PRESCHOOLS_LOCATION' from data source \n  `C:\\zjho008\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\geospatial\\PreSchoolsLocation.kml' \n  using driver `KML'\nSimple feature collection with 2290 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6878 ymin: 1.247759 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nThe message above reveals that preschool is a point feature data frame. There are a total of 2290 features and 2 fields. It is different from the previous two simple feature data frames, preschool is in wgs84 coordinates system.\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, it illustrates different ways to retrieve information related to the content of a simple feature data frame.\n\n\nThe column in the sf data.frame that contains the geometries is a list, of class sfc. The geometry list-column can be retrieved in this case by mpsz$geom or mpsz[[1]], but more a generic way uses st_geometry() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_geometry(mpsz)\n\nGeometry set for 323 features \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\n\nNote: Note that the print only displays basic information of the feature class such as type of geometry, the geographic extent of the features and the coordinate system of the data.\n\n\n\n\nBesides the basic feature information, more can be learnt about the associated attribute information in the data frame.

We are also interested in visualising the geospatial features. This is when plot() of R Graphic comes in very handy as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default plot of an sf object is a multi-plot of all attributes, up to a reasonable maximum as shown above. However, the geometry can only be chosen for plotting by using the code chunk below.\n\nplot(st_geometry(mpsz))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the plot of the sf object can also be chosen by using a specific attribute as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n“PLN_AREA_N”“PLN_AREA_C”“REGION_C”\n\n\n\nplot(mpsz[\"PLN_AREA_N\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(mpsz[\"PLN_AREA_C\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(mpsz[\"REGION_C\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: plot() is meant for plotting the geospatial object for quick observation. For a high cartographic quality plot, other R package such as tmap should be used.\n\n\n\n\nMap projection is an important property of a geospatial data. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, both geospatial data have to be projected using similar coordinate system.\nIn this section, it will illustrate how to project a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another coordinate system. The technical term of this process is called projection transformation.\n\n\nA common issue that can happen during importing process of geospatial data into R is that the coordinate system of the source data was either missing (such as due to missing .proj for ESRI shapefile) or wrongly assigned during the importing process.\nThis is an example the coordinate system of mpsz simple feature data frame by using st_crs() of sf package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21[WGS84]\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nAlthough the mpsz data frame is projected in svy21 but upon examination at the end of the print, it indicates that the EPSG is 9001. This is a wrong EPSG code because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.\nIn order to assign the correct EPSG code to the mpsz data frame, st_set_crs() of sf package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nmpsz3414 &lt;- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)\n\nNow, to inspect the CSR again by using the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz3414)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3414 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21 / Singapore TM\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21\",\n        DATUM[\"SVY21\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4757]],\n    CONVERSION[\"Singapore Transverse Mercator\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"northing (N)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"easting (E)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Cadastre, engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"Singapore - onshore and offshore.\"],\n        BBOX[1.13,103.59,1.47,104.07]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",3414]]\n\n\nNotice that the EPSG code is 3414 now.\n\n\n\nIn geospatial analytics, it is very common to transform the original data from geographic coordinate system to projected coordinate system. This is because geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if the analysis requires the use of distance or/and area measurements.\nExamining the preschool simple feature data frame as an example. The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\n\nst_geometry(preschool)\n\nGeometry set for 2290 features \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6878 ymin: 1.247759 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\nHence, this is a scenario that illustrates st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used.\nThis is due to the fact that a re-projection is needed for preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathematically.\nThe projection transformation is performed by using the code chunk below.\n\npreschool3414 &lt;- st_transform(preschool,\n                              crs = 3414)\n\n\nNote: In practice, we will need to find out the appropriate project coordinate system to use before performing the projection transformation.\n\nThe content of preschool3414 sf data frame is displayed again with the code chunk below:\n\nst_geometry(preschool3414)\n\nGeometry set for 2290 features \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 11810.03 ymin: 25596.33 xmax: 45404.24 ymax: 49300.88\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, referencing to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it is not unusual that we will come across data such as listing of Inside Airbnb. We call this kind of data aspatial data. Mainly because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, it will illustrate how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, it will be converted it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from AirBnb will be used.\n\n\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, read_csv() of readr package will be used to import listing.csv as shown in the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\nlistings &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/listings.csv\")\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() to do the job.\n\nlist(listings)\n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 3,540 × 18\n       id name      host_id host_name neighbourhood_group neighbourhood latitude\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  71609 Ensuite …  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 2  71896 B&B  Roo…  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 3  71903 Room 2-n…  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 4 275343 10min wa… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 5 275344 15 mins … 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 6 289234 Booking …  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.34\n 7 294281 5 mins w… 1521514 Elizabeth Central Region      Newton            1.31\n 8 324945 Comforta… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 9 330095 Relaxing… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n10 344803 Budget s…  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n# ℹ 3,530 more rows\n# ℹ 11 more variables: longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, room_type &lt;chr&gt;, price &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   minimum_nights &lt;dbl&gt;, number_of_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, last_review &lt;date&gt;,\n#   reviews_per_month &lt;dbl&gt;, calculated_host_listings_count &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   availability_365 &lt;dbl&gt;, number_of_reviews_ltm &lt;dbl&gt;, license &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThe output reveals that listing tibble data frame consists of 3540 rows and 18 columns. Two useful fields we are going to use in the next phase are latitude and longitude. Note that they are in decimal degree format. As a best guess, the assumption is that the data is in wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below converts listing data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages\n\nlistings_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(listings,\n                        coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                        crs = 4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 3414)\n\nThings to learn from the arguments above:\n\ncoords argument requires you to provide the column name of the x-coordinates first then followed by the column name of the y-coordinates.\ncrs argument requires you to provide the coordinates system in epsg format. EPSG: 4326 is wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System and EPSG: 3414 is Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinate System. You can search for other country’s ESPG code by referring to epsg.io.\n%&gt;% is used to nest st_transform() to transform the newly created simple feature data frame into svy21 projected coordinates system.\n\nNow to examine the content of this newly created listings_sf simple feature data frame.\n\nglimpse(listings_sf)\n\nRows: 3,540\nColumns: 17\n$ id                             &lt;dbl&gt; 71609, 71896, 71903, 275343, 275344, 28…\n$ name                           &lt;chr&gt; \"Ensuite Room (Room 1 & 2) near EXPO\", …\n$ host_id                        &lt;dbl&gt; 367042, 367042, 367042, 1439258, 143925…\n$ host_name                      &lt;chr&gt; \"Belinda\", \"Belinda\", \"Belinda\", \"Kay\",…\n$ neighbourhood_group            &lt;chr&gt; \"East Region\", \"East Region\", \"East Reg…\n$ neighbourhood                  &lt;chr&gt; \"Tampines\", \"Tampines\", \"Tampines\", \"Bu…\n$ room_type                      &lt;chr&gt; \"Private room\", \"Private room\", \"Privat…\n$ price                          &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 80, 80, 50, 50, NA, 85, 65, 45, 54,…\n$ minimum_nights                 &lt;dbl&gt; 92, 92, 92, 180, 180, 92, 92, 180, 180,…\n$ number_of_reviews              &lt;dbl&gt; 19, 24, 46, 20, 16, 12, 131, 17, 5, 60,…\n$ last_review                    &lt;date&gt; 2020-01-17, 2019-10-13, 2020-01-09, 20…\n$ reviews_per_month              &lt;dbl&gt; 0.12, 0.15, 0.29, 0.15, 0.11, 0.08, 0.8…\n$ calculated_host_listings_count &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 6, 6, 49, 49, 6, 7, 49, 49, 6, 7, 7,…\n$ availability_365               &lt;dbl&gt; 89, 148, 90, 62, 0, 88, 365, 0, 0, 365,…\n$ number_of_reviews_ltm          &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ license                        &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, \"S0399\", \"S0399\", NA, NA, \"…\n$ geometry                       &lt;POINT [m]&gt; POINT (41972.5 36390.05), POINT (…\n\n\nTable above shows the content of listing_sf. Notice that a new column called geometry has been added into the data frame. On the other hand, the longitude and latitude columns have been dropped from the data frame.\n\n\n\n\nBesides providing functions to handle (i.e. importing, exporting, assigning projection, transforming projection) geospatial data, sf package also offers a wide range of geoprocessing (also known as GIS analysis) functions.\nIn this section, it will provide learning on how to perform two commonly used geoprocessing functions, namely buffering and point in polygon count.\n\n\nThe scenario:\nThe authority is planning to upgrade the exiting cycling path. To do so, they need to acquire 5 metres of reserved land on both sides of the current cycling path. You are tasked to determine the extend of the land need to be acquired and their total area.\nThe solution:\nFirstly, st_buffer() of sf package is used to compute the 5-meter buffers around cycling paths\n\nbuffer_cycling &lt;- st_buffer(cyclingpath,\n                            dist = 5, nQuadSegs = 30)\n\nThis is followed by calculating the area of the buffers as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nbuffer_cycling$AREA &lt;- st_area(buffer_cycling)\n\nLastly, sum() of Base R will be used to derive the total land involved\n\nsum(buffer_cycling$AREA)\n\n2218855 [m^2]\n\n\nTask Accomplished!\n\n\n\nThe scenario:\nA pre-school service group want to find out the number of pre-schools in each Planning Subzone.\nThe solution:\nThe code chunk below performs two operations at once. Firstly, identifying pre-schools located inside each Planning Subzone by using st_intersects(). Next, length() of Base R is used to calculate numbers of pre-schools that fall inside each planning subzone.\n\nmpsz3414$`PreSch Count` &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(mpsz3414, preschool3414))\n\n\nWarning: This should not confused with st_intersection().\n\nThe summary statistics of the newly derived PreSch Count field can be checked by using summary() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nsummary(mpsz3414$`PreSch Count`)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

In this section, it demonstrates how to use appropriate ggplot2 functions to create functional and yet truthful statistical graphs for EDA purposes.\nFirstly, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of PreSch Density.

    "text": "In general, thematic mapping involves the use of map symbols to visualize selected properties of geographic features that are not naturally visible, such as population, temperature, crime rate, and property prices, just to mention a few.\nGeovisualisation, on the other hand, works by providing graphical ideation to render a place, a phenomenon or a process visible, enabling humans most powerful information-processing abilities – those of spatial cognition associated with our eye–brain vision system – to be directly brought to bear.\nIn this chapter, the goal is to learn how to plot functional and truthful choropleth maps by using an R package called tmap package.\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the key R package used is the tmap package in R. Besides tmap package, four other R packages will be used. They are:\n\nreadr for importing delimited text file,\ntidyr for tidying data,\ndplyr for wrangling data and\nsf for handling geospatial data.\n\nAmong the four packages, readr, tidyr and dplyr are part of tidyverse package.\n\nNote: It is advisable to read the functional description of each function before using them.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to install and load these packages in RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)\n\nNotice that, we only need to install tidyverse instead of readr, tidyr and dplyr individually.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used to create the choropleth map. They are:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) (i.e. MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL) in ESRI shapefile format. It can be downloaded at data.gov.sg This is a geospatial data. It consists of the geographical boundary of Singapore at the planning subzone level. The data is based on the URA Master Plan 2014.\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2011-2020 in csv format (i.e. respopagesextod2011to2020.csv). This is an aspatial data fie. It can be downloaded at Department of Statistics, Singapore Although it does not contain any coordinates values, but it’s PA and SZ fields can be used as unique identifiers to geocode to the MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses the st_read() function of sf package to import MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile into R as a simple feature data frame called mpsz.\n\nmpsz &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nReading layer `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL' from data source \n  `C:\\zjho008\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe contents of mpsz can be examined by using the code chunk below:\n\nmpsz\n\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\nFirst 10 features:\n   OBJECTID SUBZONE_NO       SUBZONE_N SUBZONE_C CA_IND      PLN_AREA_N\n1         1          1    MARINA SOUTH    MSSZ01      Y    MARINA SOUTH\n2         2          1    PEARL'S HILL    OTSZ01      Y          OUTRAM\n3         3          3       BOAT QUAY    SRSZ03      Y SINGAPORE RIVER\n4         4          8  HENDERSON HILL    BMSZ08      N     BUKIT MERAH\n5         5          3         REDHILL    BMSZ03      N     BUKIT MERAH\n6         6          7  ALEXANDRA HILL    BMSZ07      N     BUKIT MERAH\n7         7          9   BUKIT HO SWEE    BMSZ09      N     BUKIT MERAH\n8         8          2     CLARKE QUAY    SRSZ02      Y SINGAPORE RIVER\n9         9         13 PASIR PANJANG 1    QTSZ13      N      QUEENSTOWN\n10       10          7       QUEENSWAY    QTSZ07      N      QUEENSTOWN\n   PLN_AREA_C       REGION_N REGION_C          INC_CRC FMEL_UPD_D   X_ADDR\n1          MS CENTRAL REGION       CR 5ED7EB253F99252E 2014-12-05 31595.84\n2          OT CENTRAL REGION       CR 8C7149B9EB32EEFC 2014-12-05 28679.06\n3          SR CENTRAL REGION       CR C35FEFF02B13E0E5 2014-12-05 29654.96\n4          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 3775D82C5DDBEFBD 2014-12-05 26782.83\n5          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 85D9ABEF0A40678F 2014-12-05 26201.96\n6          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 9D286521EF5E3B59 2014-12-05 25358.82\n7          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 7839A8577144EFE2 2014-12-05 27680.06\n8          SR CENTRAL REGION       CR 48661DC0FBA09F7A 2014-12-05 29253.21\n9          QT CENTRAL REGION       CR 1F721290C421BFAB 2014-12-05 22077.34\n10         QT CENTRAL REGION       CR 3580D2AFFBEE914C 2014-12-05 24168.31\n     Y_ADDR SHAPE_Leng SHAPE_Area                       geometry\n1  29220.19   5267.381  1630379.3 MULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30...\n2  29782.05   3506.107   559816.2 MULTIPOLYGON (((29092.28 30...\n3  29974.66   1740.926   160807.5 MULTIPOLYGON (((29932.33 29...\n4  29933.77   3313.625   595428.9 MULTIPOLYGON (((27131.28 30...\n5  30005.70   2825.594   387429.4 MULTIPOLYGON (((26451.03 30...\n6  29991.38   4428.913  1030378.8 MULTIPOLYGON (((25899.7 297...\n7  30230.86   3275.312   551732.0 MULTIPOLYGON (((27746.95 30...\n8  30222.86   2208.619   290184.7 MULTIPOLYGON (((29351.26 29...\n9  29893.78   6571.323  1084792.3 MULTIPOLYGON (((20996.49 30...\n10 30104.18   3454.239   631644.3 MULTIPOLYGON (((24472.11 29...\n\n\nNotice that only the first ten records will be displayed.

This behaviour is similar to tibbles, where the intention is to provide a concise and readable output without overwhelming the console with too much data at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will import respopagsex2011to2020.csv file into RStudio and save the file into an R dataframe called popdata.\nThe task will be performed by using read_csv() function of readr package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npopdata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nBefore a thematic map can be prepared, it is required to prepare a data table with year 2020 values. The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.\n\nYOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age group 20 to 24,\nECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,\nAGED: age group 65 and above,\nTOTAL: all age groups, and\nDEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group\n\n\n\nThe following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used: - pivot_wider() of tidyr package, and - mutate(), filter(), group_by() and select() of dplyr package\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata %&gt;%\n  filter(Time == 2020) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = AG,\n              values_from = POP) %&gt;%\n  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])\n         + rowSums(.[12])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11]) +\n  rowSums(.[13:15])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`AGED` = rowSums(.[16:21])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`TOTAL` = rowSums(.[3:21])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)\n  /`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %&gt;%\n    select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`,\n          `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`,\n          `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)\n\n\n\n\nBefore performing the geo-relational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ),\n            .funs = list(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colours. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below:\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020,\n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantage of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency Ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by Planning Subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\",\n            position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, more will be shared on tmap functions that are used to plot these elements.\n\n\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elements such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. More will be shown about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing values will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n\ntm_polygons() is a wrapper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shaded according to the respective dependency values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-grey border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBesides alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\n\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what was learnt, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can we draw?\n\n\njenks method (5 classes)jenks method (10 classes)quantile method (10 classes)quantile method (15 classes)\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 10,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 10,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 15,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore getting started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, break point can be set at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, the choropleth map will be plotted by using the code chunk below:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map below is shaded in green.\n\npalette = “Greens”palette = “Greens”\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohesive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          legend.hist = TRUE,\n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style being used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of Persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby Planning Subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\",\n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arranged side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"),\n          palette = list(\"Blues\", \"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) +\n  tm_facets(by = \"REGION_N\",\n            free.coords = TRUE,\n            drop.shapes = TRUE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"),\n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp = 1, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neconomyactivemap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"ECONOMY ACTIVE\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntotalmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"TOTAL\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(economyactivemap, totalmap, asp = 1, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, a selection function can be used to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N == \"CENTRAL REGION\", ]) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          legend.hist = TRUE,\n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKam, T.S.

Do you know why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasoning\n\n\n\nDefault Behaviour of sf Objects: When you print an sf object in R, it typically displays only the first 10 rows by default. This behaviour is similar to tibbles, where the intention is to provide a concise and readable output without overwhelming the console with too much data at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will import respopagsex2011to2020.csv file into RStudio and save the file into an R dataframe called popdata.\nThe task will be performed by using read_csv() function of readr package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npopdata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nBefore a thematic map can be prepared, it is required to prepare a data table with year 2020 values. The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.\n\nYOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age group 20 to 24,\nECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,\nAGED: age group 65 and above,\nTOTAL: all age groups, and\nDEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group\n\n\n\nThe following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used: - pivot_wider() of tidyr package, and - mutate(), filter(), group_by() and select() of dplyr package\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata %&gt;%\n  filter(Time == 2020) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = AG,\n              values_from = POP) %&gt;%\n  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])\n         + rowSums(.[12])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11]) +\n  rowSums(.[13:15])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`AGED` = rowSums(.[16:21])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`TOTAL` = rowSums(.[3:21])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)\n  /`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %&gt;%\n    select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`,\n          `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`,\n          `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)\n\n\n\n\nBefore performing the geo-relational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ),\n            .funs = list(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Choropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colours. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below:\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020,\n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantage of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency Ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by Planning Subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\",\n            position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, more will be shared on tmap functions that are used to plot these elements.\n\n\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elements such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. More will be shown about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing values will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n\ntm_polygons() is a wrapper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shaded according to the respective dependency values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-grey border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBesides alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\n\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what was learnt, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can we draw?\n\n\njenks method (5 classes)jenks method (10 classes)quantile method (10 classes)quantile method (15 classes)\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 10,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 10,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 15,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.8, lwd = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore getting started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, break point can be set at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, the choropleth map will be plotted by using the code chunk below:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map below is shaded in green.\n\npalette = “Greens”palette = “Greens”\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohesive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          legend.hist = TRUE,\n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style being used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of Persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby Planning Subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\",\n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arranged side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"),\n          palette = list(\"Blues\", \"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) +\n  tm_facets(by = \"REGION_N\",\n            free.coords = TRUE,\n            drop.shapes = TRUE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"),\n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp = 1, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neconomyactivemap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"ECONOMY ACTIVE\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntotalmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons(\"TOTAL\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(economyactivemap, totalmap, asp = 1, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, a selection function can be used to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N == \"CENTRAL REGION\", ]) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          legend.hist = TRUE,\n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)"
