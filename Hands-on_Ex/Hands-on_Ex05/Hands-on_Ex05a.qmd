## Overview

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to compute Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (GMSA) by using **spdep** package. By the end to this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

-   import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of **sf** package,
-   import csv file using appropriate function of **readr** package,
-   perform relational join using appropriate join function of **dplyr** package,
-   compute Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics by using appropriate functions of **spdep** package,
    -   plot Moran scatterplot,
    -   compute and plot spatial correlogram using appropriate function of **spdep** package.
-   provide statistically correct interpretation of GSA statistics.
