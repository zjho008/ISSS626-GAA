These models are calibrated using a set of known outcomes and predictors (or variables).\n\nGeospatial predictive modelling is based on the idea that the events being predicted are spatially constrained, meaning their distribution is not random or uniform across space. When working with geographically referenced data, factors such as infrastructure, sociocultural elements, and topography influence where events occur. Geospatial predictive modelling aims to explain these spatial constraints and influences by correlating past event locations with environmental factors that shape their distribution.\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the goal is to learn how to build predictive models using geographical random forest method. By the end of this hands-on exercise, it would have helped to acquire the skills of:\n\n-   preparing training and test data sets by using appropriate data sampling methods,\n-   calibrating predictive models by using both geospatial statistical learning and machine learning methods,\n-   comparing and selecting the best model for predicting the future outcome,\n-   predicting the future outcomes by using the best model calibrated.\n\n## The Data\n\n-   **Aspatial dataset**:\n    -   HDB Resale data: a list of HDB resale transacted prices in Singapore from Jan 2017 onwards. It is in csv format which can be downloaded from Data.gov.sg.\n-   **Geospatial dataset**:\n    -   *MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL*: a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2014 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data. It is in ESRI shapefile format. This data set was also downloaded from Data.gov.sg\n-   **Locational factors with geographic coordinates**:\n    -   Downloaded from **Data.gov.sg**.\n        -   **Eldercare** data is a list of eldercares in Singapore.

It is in geojson format.\n    -   Downloaded from **Datamall.lta.gov.sg**.\n        -   **MRT** data is a list of MRT/LRT stations in Singapore with the station names and codes. It is in shapefile format.\n        -   **Bus stops** data is a list of bus stops in Singapore. It is in shapefile format.\n-   **Locational factors without geographic coordinates**:\n    -   Downloaded from **Data.gov.sg**.\n        -   **Primary school** data is extracted from the list on General information of schools from data.gov portal. It is in csv format.\n    -   Retrieved/Scraped from **other sources**\n        -   **CBD** coordinates obtained from Google.\n        -   **Shopping malls** data is a list of Shopping malls in Singapore obtained from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shopping_malls_in_Singapore).\n        -   **Good primary schools** is a list of primary schools that are ordered in ranking in terms of popularity and this can be found at [Local Salary Forum](https://www.salary.sg/2021/best-primary-schools-2021-by-popularity).\n        \n## Installing and Loading R Packages\n\nThe code chunk below performs 3 tasks:\n\n-   A list of called packages will be created and will consists of all the R packages required to accomplish this exercise.\n-   Check if R packages or package have been installed in R, otherwise they will be installed.\n-   After all the R packages have been installed, they will be loaded into the R environment.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spdep, GWmodel, SpatialML,\n               tmap, rsample, Metrics, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n",
