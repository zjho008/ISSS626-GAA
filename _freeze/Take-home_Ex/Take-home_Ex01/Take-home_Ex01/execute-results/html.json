Vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, account for more than half of these fatalities.\n\nRoad traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for individuals aged 5 to 29. Additionally, two-thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working age (18–59 years). Despite having only about 60% of the world's vehicles, low- and middle-income countries account for 92% of road traffic fatalities.\n\nBeyond the human toll, road accidents impose a significant economic burden on victims and their families due to medical costs and the loss of productivity from those who are killed or disabled. On a national level, these injuries cost countries around 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThailand has the most dangerous roads in Southeast Asia and ranks among the worst globally, with approximately 20,000 deaths from road accidents each year, averaging 56 deaths per day [(WHO)](https://www.who.int/thailand/news/feature-stories/detail/turning-tragedy-into-action--advocacy-and-survival-on-thailand-s-roads) and a million injuries each year, incurring an economic loss of 500,000 million baht.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Thailand saw a rise in accident frequency, with 19% occurring on the national highways, which serve as the main public roads connecting regions, provinces, and key locations. Nationally, there is a 66% chance of encountering accident-prone areas, also known as *'black spots.'* These are distributed as follows: 66% on straight road sections, 13% on curves, 6% at median points of cross intersections, 5% at T- or Y-intersections, 3% at cross intersections, and 2% on both bridges and steep slopes.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe primary causes of road traffic accidents can be attributed to behavioural factors, such as: driver behaviour, performance, and environmental factors, like weather conditions and road design. While past studies using Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (SPPA) have explored these factors, they often overlook the impact of *temporal* factors, such as season or time of day.\n\nThe task is to identify factors influencing road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) using both spatial and spatio-temporal point patterns analysis. The objectives include visualizing spatio-temporal accident dynamics and conducting detailed spatial and temporal analyses using Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\n\n## Datasets\n\nThree basic data sets must be used for this exercise, they are:\n\n-   [Thailand Road Accident \\[2019-2022\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-road-accident-2019-2022) on Kaggle\n\n    -   This dataset provides comprehensive statistics on recorded road accidents in Thailand, spanning from approximately 2019 to 2022. The data was sourced from raw information provided by the [Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport](https://www.mots.go.th/news/category/411). The dataset encompasses various aspects of road accidents and aims to shed light on the trends and patterns within this critical area of concern, analysis of this data could be crucial in guiding road safety policies and measures\n\n-   [Thailand Roads (OpenStreetMap Export)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tha_roads) on HDX.\n\n-   [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) on HDX.\n\n## Setting Up\n\n### Setting up the R environment\n\n\nIn this exercise, seven R packages will be used, they are:\n\n| Packages                                                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                            |\n|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|\n| [*sf*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)                                                                            | A relatively new R package specially designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R                                                                                                                 |\n| [*spatstat*](https://spatstat.org/)                                  | Which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis.
