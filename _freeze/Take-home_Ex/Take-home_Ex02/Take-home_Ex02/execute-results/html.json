Spatial data handling\n    -   **sf**, **rgdal**, **spdep** and **sfdep**\n2.  Attribute data handling\n    -   **tidyverse**, especially **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr**\n3.  Choropleth mapping\n    -   **tmap**\n4.  Multivariate data visualisation and analysis\n    -   **coorplot**, **ggpubr**, and **heatmaply**\n5.  Cluster analysis\n    -   **cluster**\n    -   **ClustGeo**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spdep, sfdep, tmap, tidyverse, ClustGeo,\n               cluster, factoextra, NbClust, heatmaply,\n               corrplot, psych, GGally, ggpubr, plotly)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### The Data\n\nFor this exercise, two data sets will be utilised. They are:\n\n-  [Thailand Domestic Tourism Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-domestic-tourism-statistics) at Kaggle.\n-  [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) at HDX. the province boundary data set is used for this exercise.\n\n#### Loading the Attribute Data\n\nThere are 2 versions of this dataset `thailand_domestic_tourism_2019_2023.csv` & `thailand_domestic_tourism_2019_2023_ver2.csv`. Version 2 will be used for this exercise.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthdt <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/thailand_domestic_tourism_2019_2023_ver2.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Loading the Geospatial Data (Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries)\n\nThe code chunk below is used to import the Subnational Administrative Boundaries of Thailand. Level 1 will be used as it represents the province boundary as seen in the HDX website. \n\n![](images/level1.png)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthadmin <- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                 layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121' from data source \n  `C:\\zjho008\\ISSS626-GAA\\Take-home_Ex\\Take-home_Ex02\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 97.34336 ymin: 5.613038 xmax: 105.637 ymax: 20.46507\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Personal Notes (to be removed)\n\nData covers several years and have several attributes\n\ngeospatial data - is in high res - has small multiple islands - have to note the small islands - probably remove or have it in one of the territory \n\npre , during , post covid (three temporal terms)\nchanges in revenue and other measures to be investigated. \n\nUneven spatial distributions\n\nIf key indicators (multiple indicators to look out for) are independent from - space, space & time (cross sectional - pre, etc during post covid)\n\n\nIf it is indeed spatial and spatial temporal dependent \n\ncluster - outliers - hotspots - local moran I to detect cluster and outlier \nG* statistics to discover hot and cold spots. \n\nEmerging hotspots - have to be continuous - for 3 years, 4 years, months etc. \nNote for this data set what is the constraint to see the data continuously.\n\nsfdep - advantages - \n\nspacetime cube - created by sfdep\n\n\npoints below the teen birth rate is about LISA\n\nhave to recode the date\n \nRefer to hands on ex - hunan case - maybe the GPD - ",
